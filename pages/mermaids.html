  <h1>Mermaids</h1>
  <p>
    In folklore, a mermaid is an aquatic creature with the head and upper body
    of a female human and the tail of a fish.[1] Mermaids appear in the folklore
    of many cultures worldwide, including Europe, Asia, and Africa. Mermaids are
    sometimes associated with perilous events such as floods, storms,
    shipwrecks, and drownings. In other folk traditions (or sometimes within the
    same traditions), they can be benevolent or beneficent, bestowing boons or
    falling in love with humans. The male equivalent of the mermaid is the
    merman, also a familiar figure in folklore and heraldry. Although traditions
    about and sightings of mermen are less common than those of mermaids, they
    are generally assumed to co-exist with their female counterparts. The male
    and the female collectively are sometimes referred to as merfolk or
    merpeople. The Western concept of mermaids as beautiful, seductive singers
    may have been influenced by the Sirens of Greek mythology, which were
    originally half-birdlike, but came to be pictured as half-fishlike in the
    Christian era. Historical accounts of mermaids, such as those reported by
    Christopher Columbus during his exploration of the Caribbean, may have been
    sightings of manatees or similar aquatic mammals. While there is no evidence
    that mermaids exist outside folklore, reports of mermaid sightings continue
    to the present day. Mermaids have been a popular subject of art and
    literature in recent centuries, such as in Hans Christian Andersen's
    literary fairy tale "The Little Mermaid" (1836). They have subsequently been
    depicted in operas, paintings, books, comics, animation, and live-action
    films.

  <h2>Textual attestations</h2>
  <p>
    The earliest text describing the siren as fish-tailed occurs in the Liber
    Monstrorum de diversis generibus (7th–mid 8th cent.), which described sirens
    as "sea girls" (marinae pullae) whose beauty in form and sweet song allure
    seafarers, but beneath the human head and torso, have the scaly tail-end of
    a fish with which they can navigate the sea. "Sirens are mermaids" (Old High
    German/Early Middle High German: Sirêne sínt méremanniu) is explicit in the
    aforementioned Old German Physiologus (11th century]). The Middle English
    bestiary (mid-13th century) clearly means "mermaid" when it explains the
    siren to be a mereman, stating that she has a body and breast like that of a
    maiden but joined, at the navel, by a body part which is definitely fish,
    with fins growing out of her. Old French verse bestiaries (e.g. Philipp de
    Thaun's version, written c. 1121–1139) also accommodated by stating that a
    part of the siren may be bird or fish.
