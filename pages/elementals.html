  <h1>Elementals</h1>
  <p>
    An elemental is a mythic being that is described in occult and alchemical
    works from around the time of the European Renaissance, and particularly
    elaborated in the 16th century works of Paracelsus. According to Paracelsus
    and his subsequent followers, there are four categories of elementals, which
    are gnomes, undines, sylphs, and salamanders.These correspond to the four
    Empedoclean elements of antiquity: earth, water, air, and fire,
    respectively. Terms employed for beings associated with alchemical elements
    vary by source and gloss.

  <h2>History</h2>
  <p>
    The Paracelsian concept of elementals draws from several much older
    traditions in mythology and religion. Common threads can be found in
    folklore, animism, and anthropomorphism. Examples of creatures such as the
    Pygmy were taken from Greek mythology. The elements of earth, water, air,
    and fire, were classed as the fundamental building blocks of nature. This
    system prevailed in the Classical world and was highly influential in
    medieval natural philosophy. Although Paracelsus uses these foundations and
    the popular preexisting names of elemental creatures, he is doing so to
    present new ideas which expand on his own philosophical system. The
    homunculus is another example of a Paracelsian idea with roots in earlier
    alchemical, scientific, and folklore traditions.

  <h2>Paracelsus</h2>
  <p>
    In his 16th-century work A Book on Nymphs, Sylphs, Pygmies, and Salamanders,
    and on the Other Spirits, Paracelsus identified mythological beings as
    belonging to one of the four elements. Part of the Philosophia Magna, this
    book was first printed in 1566 after Paracelsus' death. He wrote the book to
    "describe the creatures that are outside the cognizance of the light of
    nature, how they are to be understood, what marvellous works God has
    created". He states that there is more bliss in describing these "divine
    objects" than in describing fencing, court etiquette, cavalry, and other
    worldly pursuits. The following is his archetypal being for each of the four
    elements: Gnome, being of earth Undine, being of water Sylph, being of air
    Salamander, being of fire
