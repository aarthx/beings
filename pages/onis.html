  <h1>Onis</h1>
  <p>
    An oni (鬼おに) is a kind of yōkai, demon, orc, ogre, or troll in Japanese
    folklore. Oni are mostly known for their fierce and evil nature manifested
    in their propensity for murder and cannibalism. Notwithstanding their evil
    reputation, oni possess intriguingly complex aspects that cannot be brushed
    away simply as evil. They are typically portrayed as hulking figures with
    one or more horns growing out of their heads. Stereotypically, they are
    conceived of as red, blue, black, yellow, or white-colored, wearing
    loincloths of tiger pelt, and carrying iron kanabō clubs. They are creatures
    which instill fear and feelings of danger due to their grotesque outward
    appearance, their wild and sometimes strange behavior and their powers. They
    are popular characters in Japanese art, literature, and theater and appear
    as stock villains in the well-known fairytales of Momotarō (Peach Boy),
    Issun-bōshi, and Kobutori Jīsan. Although Oni have been described as
    frightening creatures, they have become tamer in modern culture as people
    tell less frightening stories about them like Oni Mask and Red Oni Who
    Cried. Shuten-dōji has been regarded as the most famous and strongest oni in
    Japan. The legend of Shuten-dōji has been described since the 14th century
    in various arts, traditional performing arts and literature such as
    emakimono, jōruri, noh and kabuki. The tachi (Japanese long sword)
    "Dōjigiri" with which Minamoto no Yorimitsu decapitated Shuten-dōji' in the
    legend is now designated as a National Treasure and one of the Tenka-Goken
    (Five Greatest Swords Under Heaven).

  <h2>Description</h2>
  <p>
    Depictions of yokai oni vary widely but usually portray them as hideous,
    gigantic ogre-like creatures with a single horn or multiple horns emerging
    from their heads, with sharp claws, wild hair, and fang-like tusks. They are
    often depicted wearing tiger-skin loincloths and carrying iron clubs called
    kanabō (金棒).This image leads to the expression "oni with an iron club"
    (鬼に金棒, oni-ni-kanabō), that is, to be invincible or undefeatable. Their
    skin may have various colors, but red, blue, and green are particularly
    common.They may sometimes also be depicted as black-skinned, or
    yellow-skinned.They may occasionally be depicted with a third eye on their
    forehead, or extra fingers and toes. They are predominantly male but can be
    female. Females becoming oni has been attributed to them being overcome with
    grief or jealousy. Oni can come in many different sizes ranging in both
    weight and height.
