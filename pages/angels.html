  <h1>Angels</h1>
  <p>
    In various theistic religious traditions, an angel is a supernatural
    spiritual being who serves God. Abrahamic religions often depict angels as
    benevolent celestial intermediaries between God (or Heaven) and humanity.
    Other roles include protectors and guides for humans, such as guardian
    angels, and servants of God.Abrahamic religions describe angelic
    hierarchies, which vary by religion and sect. Some angels have specific
    names (such as Gabriel or Michael) or titles (such as seraph or archangel).
    Those expelled from Heaven are called fallen angels, distinct from the
    heavenly host. Angels in art are usually shaped like humans of extraordinary
    beauty, though this is not always the caseâ€”sometimes, they can be portrayed
    in a frightening, inhuman manner.They are often identified in Christian
    artwork with bird wings,halos,and divine light.

  <h2>Theosophy</h2>
  <p>
    In the teachings of the Theosophical Society, Devas are regarded as living
    either in the atmospheres of the planets of the Solar System (Planetary
    Angels) or inside the Sun (Solar Angels) and they help to guide the
    operation of the processes of nature such as the process of evolution and
    the growth of plants; their appearance is reputedly like colored flames
    about the size of a human. It is believed by Theosophists that devas can be
    observed when the third eye is activated. Some (but not most) devas
    originally incarnated as human beings. It is believed by Theosophists that
    nature spirits, elementals (gnomes, undines, sylphs, and salamanders), and
    fairies also can be observed when the third eye is activated. It is
    maintained by Theosophists that these less evolutionarily developed beings
    have never been previously incarnated as humans; they are regarded as being
    on a separate line of spiritual evolution called the "deva evolution";
    eventually, as their souls advance as they reincarnate, it is believed they
    will incarnate as devas. It is asserted by Theosophists that all of the
    above-mentioned beings possess etheric bodies that are composed of etheric
    matter, a type of matter finer and more pure that is composed of smaller
    particles than ordinary physical plane matter.

    <h2>Zoroastrianism</h2>
    <p>
      In Zoroastrianism there are different angel-like figures. For example,
      each person has one guardian angel, called Fravashi. They patronize human
      beings and other creatures, and also manifest God's energy. The Amesha
      Spentas have often been regarded as angels, although there is no direct
      reference to them conveying messages,but are rather emanations of Ahura
      Mazda ("Wise Lord", God); they initially appeared in an abstract fashion
      and then later became personalized, associated with various aspects of
      creation.
