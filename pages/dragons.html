  <h1>Dragons</h1>
  <p>
    A dragon is a reptilian legendary creature that appears in the folklore of
    many cultures worldwide. Beliefs about dragons vary considerably through
    regions, but dragons in western cultures since the High Middle Ages have
    often been depicted as winged, horned, and capable of breathing fire.
    Dragons in eastern cultures are usually depicted as wingless, four-legged,
    serpentine creatures with above-average intelligence. Commonalities between
    dragons' traits are often a hybridization of feline, reptilian, and avian
    features. Scholars believe huge extinct or migrating crocodiles bear the
    closest resemblance, especially when encountered in forested or swampy
    areas, and are most likely the template of modern Oriental dragon imagery.

      Dragons and dragon motifs are featured in many works of modern literature,
      particularly within the fantasy genre. As early as the eighteenth century,
      critical thinkers such as Denis Diderot were already asserting that too
      much literature had been published on dragons: "There are already in books
      all too many fabulous stories of dragons". In Lewis Carroll's classic
      children's novel Through the Looking-Glass (1872), one of the inset poems
      describes the Jabberwock, a kind of dragon. One of the most iconic modern
      dragons is Smaug from J. R. R. Tolkien's classic novel, The Hobbit.
      Dragons also appear in the best-selling Harry Potter series of children's
      novels by J. K. Rowling.Other prominent works depicting dragons include
      Anne McCaffrey's Dragonriders of Pern, Ursula K. Le Guin's Earthsea Cycle,
      George R. R. Martin's series A Song of Ice and Fire, and Christopher
      Paolini's Inheritance Cycle. Sandra Martina Schwab writes, "With a few
      exceptions, including McCaffrey's Pern novels and the 2002 film Reign of
      Fire, dragons seem to fit more into the medievalized setting of fantasy
      literature than into the more technological world of science fiction.
      Indeed, they have been called the emblem of fantasy. The hero's fight
      against the dragon emphasizes and celebrates his masculinity, whereas
      revisionist fantasies of dragons and dragon-slaying often undermine
      traditional gender roles. In children's literature the friendly dragon
      becomes a powerful ally in battling the child's fears." The popular
      role-playing game system Dungeons & Dragons (D&D) makes heavy use of
      dragons.

  <h2>Myth origins</h2>
  <p>
    Draconic creatures appear in virtually all cultures around the globeand the
    earliest attested reports of draconic creatures resemble giant snakes.
    Draconic creatures are first described in the mythologies of the ancient
    Near East and appear in ancient Mesopotamian art and literature. Stories
    about storm-gods slaying giant serpents occur throughout nearly all
    Indo-European and Near Eastern mythologies. Famous prototypical draconic
    creatures include the mušḫuššu of ancient Mesopotamia; Apep in Egyptian
    mythology; Vṛtra in the Rigveda; the Leviathan in the Hebrew Bible;
    Grand'Goule in the Poitou region in France; Python, Ladon, Wyvern, and
    Kulshedra in Albanian Mythology and the Lernaean Hydra in Greek mythology;
    Jörmungandr, Níðhöggr, and Fafnir in Norse mythology; and the dragon from
    Beowulf. Nonetheless, scholars dispute where the idea of a dragon originates
    from and a wide variety of hypotheses have been proposed.
