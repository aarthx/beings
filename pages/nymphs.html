  <h1>Nymphs</h1>
  <p>
    A nymph (Ancient Greek: νύμφη, romanized: nýmphē, Modern Greek: nímfi; Attic
    Greek: [nýmpʰɛː], Modern Greek: [ˈniɱfi]) in ancient Greek folklore is a
    minor female nature deity. Different from Greek goddesses, nymphs are
    generally regarded as personifications of nature, are typically tied to a
    specific place or landform, and are usually depicted as maidens. They were
    not necessarily immortal, but lived much longer than human beings. They are
    often divided into various broad subgroups, such as the Meliae (ash tree
    nymphs), the Dryads (oak tree nymphs), the Naiads (freshwater nymphs), the
    Nereids (sea nymphs), and the Oreads (mountain nymphs). Nymphs are often
    featured in classic works of art, literature, mythology, and fiction. Since
    the Middle Ages, nymphs have been sometimes popularly associated or even
    confused with fairies.

  <h2>Ancient Greek mythology</h2>
  <p>
    Nymphs were sometimes beloved by many and dwelt in specific areas related to
    the natural environment: e.g. mountainous regions; forests; springs. Other
    nymphs were part of the retinue of a god (such as Dionysus, Hermes, or Pan)
    or of a goddess (generally the huntress Artemis). The Greek nymphs were also
    spirits invariably bound to places, not unlike the Latin genius loci, and
    sometimes this produced complicated myths like the cult of Arethusa to
    Sicily. In some of the works of the Greek-educated Latin poets, the nymphs
    gradually absorbed into their ranks the indigenous Italian divinities of
    springs and streams (Juturna, Egeria, Carmentis, Fontus) while the Lymphae
    (originally Lumpae), Italian water goddesses, owing to the accidental
    similarity of their names, could be identified with the Greek Nymphae. The
    classical mythologies of the Roman poets were unlikely to have affected the
    rites and cults of individual nymphs venerated by country people in the
    springs and clefts of Latium. Among the Roman literate class, their sphere
    of influence was restricted and they appear almost exclusively as divinities
    of the watery element.

  <h2>Nymphs and fairies</h2>
  <p>
    Nymphs are often depicted in classic works across art, literature,
    mythology, and fiction. They are often associated with the medieval romances
    or Renaissance literature of the elusive fairies or elves.

  <h2>Sleeping nymph</h2>
  <p>
    A motif that entered European art during the Renaissance was the idea of a
    statue of a nymph sleeping in a grotto or spring.This motif supposedly came
    from an Italian report of a Roman sculpture of a nymph at a fountain above
    the River Danube. The report, and an accompanying poem supposedly on the
    fountain describing the sleeping nymph, are now generally concluded to be a
    fifteenth-century forgery, but the motif proved influential among artists
    and landscape gardeners for several centuries after, with copies seen at
    neoclassical gardens such as the grotto at Stourhead.
